What it is
==================
-  Scope and goal

*CERN Analysis Preservation* - capture, preserve and reuse analyses information in HEP.

CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is an innovative digital library service for capture and reuse of HEP experimental data analyses information. The service is being developed and supported by the collaborative effort of SIS, IT, in partnership with the major LHC collaborations.

By structuring and capturing the research data analysis workflow steps and resulting digital objects on top of final results and formal publications, CAP  will not only facilitate better preservation techiniques, but also provide better access to ongoing works.

The ultimate goal of CAP is to improve both human and machine readability of analyses outputs, and enable reproduction even many years after its initial publication, permitting to extend impact of perserved analyses through validation and recasting projects.

The High Energy Physics community has been tirelessly exploring and adopting innovative forms of communciation to ensure the ever growing information needs of the community members are sufficiently met. CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is another attempt to reinforce the current communication model, and make collaborative research easier.
