Background
==================
The HEP community has been tirelessly exploring and adopting innovative forms of communciation to ensure the ever growing information needs of the community members are sufficiently met. CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is another attempt to reinforce the current communication model. By capturing the research data analysis workflow steps and resulting digital objects on top of final results and formal publications, CAP will unprecedentedly make analyses  the machine actionability of documented analyses  build a concrete foundation for the future reuse of valuable analyses data and codes.
